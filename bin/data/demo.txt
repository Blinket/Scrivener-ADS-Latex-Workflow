***

##### Yellow: #####

> The completeness of the survey is derived through simulated 
> quasar photometry, and this completeness estimate is checked 
> using a sample of quasars selected by their photometric 
> variability within the BOSS footprint

***

##### Orange: #####

> We probe the faint end of the QLF to Mi (z = 2.2) ≈ −24.5 and see 
> a clear break in the QLF at all redshifts up to z = 3.5.

***

##### Yellow: #####

> A log-linear relation (in log Φ∗ −M∗) for a luminosity evolution 
> and density evolution model is found to adequately describe our 
> data within the range 2.2 < z < 3.5; across this interval the 
> break luminosity increases by a factor of ∼2.6 while Φ∗ declines 
> by a factor of ∼8.

***

##### Orange: #####

> At z 2.2 our data are reasonably well fit by a pure luminosity 
> evolution model, and only a weak signature of “AGN downsizing” is 
> seen, in line with recent studies of the hard X-ray luminosity
