\f0\fs28 \cf0 Interactive figures give the reader the ability to manipulate the information contained in an image which can add clarity or help further the author's narrative.  These figures consist of two parts, the figure file in a specific format and a javascript and html frame work that provides the interactive control.  An example of an interactive figure is a 3D model.\
The underlying figure is a X3D file while x3dom.js is the javascript driver that displays it. An author created interface is added via a html wrapper. The first 3D model published by the AAS Journals using this technique was [#2014ApJ...793..127V;].\
Authors should consult the online tutorials for more information on how to construct their own interactive figures.\
\
As with animations authors should include a non-interactive regular figure to use as an example.  The example figure should also indicate to the reader that the enhanced figure is interactive and can be accessed online.}
